# dragupload-serbandr

This is a repo containing the dragupload Foundry mod (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dragupload/) except it has a few of my own additions - you can create scenes as well as instantly call Tokenizer when you create a character if you have that mod installed (https://foundryvtt.com/packages/vtta-tokenizer). This was tested using v10.291, no clue if it works on v11.
